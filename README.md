<h1 align="center">My 1st Python Automation Project</h1>
<p align="center">Built with 0 prior knowledge on the libraries used, in 1 day</p>
<hr>
<p>My goal with this project was to have my first interaction with automation in Python by solving a real problem from my daily life, exploring functions like the powerful built in <code>open()</code> and an amazing library like <code>Selenium</code>.</br></br>It was a wonderful experience; a great way to keep my mind focused by solving a relevant "problem" to myself and solidifying knowledge (I'm looking at you, Python Classes).</p><hr><h3>Some background</h3><p><b>Velaris Eroica Awards</b> is a project I started to keep the guild members of my guild, for the only game I play, engaged and motivated. My girlfriend and I keep track of their performances through a system of spreadsheets I designed and then we reward them for their efforts.</br></br>It used to be quite the process: gathering the data, preparing it to turn it into actionable bot commands, hosting a weekly raffle event, then notifying the winners to finally prepare their actual rewards...</p><b>But Python is here to change my life for good</b>.<hr><h3>So what is exactly what I did here?</h3>
<ul>
<li>I used the <code>open()</code> function to read a couple files I created to input the name of the participants for the two different awards we offer</li>
<li>Then I created a Python Class to avoid messing around with <code>global statements</code>, getting to practice a bunch, and created some very usedul functions to turn these names into bot commands, with the right arguments and values</li>
<li><b>Selenium</b> allowed me to manipulate a <b>Firefox WebDriver</b> in order to bring automation into the next level (for obvious reasons I won't mention exactly how but all you need to know is that Selenium is a fantastic tool when you need to automate your browser)</li>
<li><b>*UPDATED*</b> - It performs the raffle in the right channel now too!</li>
<li>Now I'll sit and enjoy creating these raffles again!</li>
</ul>
<hr>You can tell I'm quite proud of the outcome; I'm fascinated by the power of this wonderful snake and I will continue exploring its world for sure.

That's it by now from your friendly Python-lover neighbour! But definitely not the last time you'll hear from me.
